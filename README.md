# omnistack8-backend
Omnistack is a week that @rocketseat offers an introduction to these technologies: NodeJS, React and ReactNative. So everyone that participate, develop a project using these technologies to build the backend, frontend and mobile app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the backend in the development mode.<br>
It's using the nodemon, so will reload the server everytime that you save a file.

## Learn More

To learn NodeJS, check out the [Rocketseat website](https://rocketseat.com.br/starter/curso-gratuito-nodejs), where there is a NodeJS free course. It's in Portuguese, so if you know only English, it's an opportunity to learn a new language :)
