It's simple. You'll enter your github username, after that you'll see the others users and can :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: them. If another user likes you and you likes him, it will show a "It's a match!" :smile:

This project came from a week offered by @rocketseat, where we have a little introduction to these following technologies: NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native.

### Built With

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Getting Started

To get this project running locally, follow these simple steps below.

### Prerequisites

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kelvin-fernandes/omnistack8-backend.git
```

3. Install dependencies packages

```sh
yarn
```

## Usage

To run locally just do it

```sh
yarn dev #Runs the backend in the development mode.
```

It's using the nodemon, so it will reload the server everytime that you modify and save js or css file.

This project has a frontend and mobile app too. So, to get a full experience, clone
the following repos and get the README to have all things running.
